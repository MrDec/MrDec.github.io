<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I am currently a Ph.D student, Department of Computer Science and Technology, <a href='https://en.uestc.edu.cn'>University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)</a>. My supervisor is <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Uw8zvfIAAAAJ'>Prof. Luping Ji</a>. I became a Ph.D student through the joint master-doctor program in my second year of master's degree. I received my Bachelor's degree in computer science and technology at <a href='https://english.ysu.edu.cn/'>Yanshan University (YSU)</a> (Hebei Province).

My research interest includes computer vision and infrared small target detection. I am also interested in multi-modal and visual language model. If you have any questions about my research, please feel free to contact me <a href=''>dwwuestc@163.com</a>.
